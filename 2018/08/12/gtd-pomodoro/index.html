Completing those actions should realize <strong>the most value possible at this very point in time for each unit of time invested</strong>. You start capturing, processing processing, organizing  and prioritizing all tasks into one big beautiful next action list.</p>
<p>The caveat of those organizational systems is this: <strong>the only moment when value is realized is when tasks get done</strong>. All other activities managing your organizational system have <strong>negative value</strong>. It costs time, and inherently has no value.</p>
<p>The question is, now what? If you are like me, actually putting in the work is not something that comes in naturally. To really start tackling the next actions, I devised a process which removes any ambiguity and uncertainness from this execution phase; freeing up mental resources for actually executing the tasks that brings in the most value.</p>
<h2 id="1-The-Daily-Practice"><a href="#1-The-Daily-Practice" class="headerlink" title="1. The Daily Practice"></a>1. The Daily Practice</h2><p>The practice is quite simply.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Select the three Most Important Tasks (MITs)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allocate the average daily pomodoro capacity (ADPC) to those three MITs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Start banging out those pomodoro‚Äôs</strong></li>
</ul>

But crucial for making sure that your day has focus, as you do not want to fritter away time by urgent bot not important tasks.</p>

If you are on average able to push through six pomodoro‚Äôs each day, it is possible to start allocating those precious pomodoro‚Äôs to the task you value the most. For this reason, it is very handy to start logging the pomodoro‚Äôs you complete.</p>

<h3 id="Start-banging-out-those-pomodoro‚Äôs"><a href="#Start-banging-out-those-pomodoro‚Äôs" class="headerlink" title="Start banging out those pomodoro‚Äôs"></a>Start banging out those pomodoro‚Äôs</h3><p>This is where the magic happens. Adhere to the following golden rules:</p>
<p><strong>Each pomodoro‚Ä¶</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>‚Ä¶ has a chrystal-clear defined activity which can be completed in 25 minutes.</strong> This is the key aspect of working with pomodoro‚Äôs: between start and end of each pomodoro no other activity is allowed. Defend this with your life.</li>
<li><p><strong>‚Ä¶ has to be completed</strong>: when disrupted, add the lost time afterwards</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>Motivation = (expectancy * value )/(impulsivess * delay)</code></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
